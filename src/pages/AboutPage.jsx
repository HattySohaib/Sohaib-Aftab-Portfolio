            I am an Engineering student pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and

        <p className="story-body">
          I was exposed to various tech gadgets very early on in life, which
          instilled a keen interest in me for Technology. In my{" "}
          <span>8th standard</span>, I taught myself my first programming
          language, <span> Java</span>. But I quickly realized thereâ€™s only so
          much I can self-teach myself. So I decided to make a career in Tech.
        </p>
        <p className="story-body">
          In 2022, I joined IIITDM Kurnool and pursued my dream of becoming a
          <span> Software Engineer</span>. I had taken up <span> Python </span>
          during my +2 in CBSE. So, I quickly grasped some basic CS concepts
          during my first year and became a <span>MERN</span> developer.
        </p>
        <p className="story-body">
          Even as a child, my motivation behind learning Programming was to
          build things that I can use or enjoy. I was always fascinated by{" "}
          <span>creation</span>. That continues even today, and I have worked on
          various freelance and personal projects that either support a
          business, or make lives easier for people.
        </p>
        <p className="story-body">
          Presently, I am making myself fluent in{" "}
          <span>Data Structures and Algorithms</span> to improve my problem
          solving skills so I can build more efficient and better products. I am
          also getting my hands dirty in <span>Machine Learning</span> and
          Cross-Platform Development. I will leave you a brief about my
          educational background in case you,
