# Sohaib Aftab Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a showcase of my work, skills, and journey as a developer and engineering student. Everything here is custom-designed and built using React, with animations powered by Framer Motion. The preloader is inspired by Dennis Snellenberg, but the overall design is completely original.

## About Me
Hi! I'm Sohaib Aftab, currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at IIITDM Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. My passion for technology started early, teaching myself Java in 8th grade and Python during my +2 in CBSE. Since joining IIITDM, I've become a MERN developer and have worked on both frontend-heavy and backend-heavy projects, including freelance and personal work.

## Skills
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- React Native (cross-platform mobile apps)
- RESTful APIs, Authentication, Database Management
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Machine Learning
- UI/UX: Completely original designs, custom CSS, and interactive layouts.
- Always learning: Open to feedback, new tech, and collaboration!

## Forte-Folio
My curated tech stacks and toolsâ€”languages, frameworks, and utilities I use most. I believe in growing with technology, so my forte-folio is always evolving.

## Work
A selection of projects that solve real-world problems or make lives easier. Includes freelance and personal projects, each detailed with tech used, hashtags, and source/demo links.

## Design & Animation
- Fully responsive, theme-aware UI (light/dark modes)
- Custom preloader inspired by Dennis Snellenberg
- Animations and transitions with Framer Motion

## Contact & Opportunities
I'm open to internship opportunities in SDE roles, and always looking for ways to collaborate or improve. Feel free to connect, share feedback, or view my resume!

_This portfolio is a testament to my love for building, creating, and growing in tech. Thanks for visiting!_

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
